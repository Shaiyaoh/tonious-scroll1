Walk the path with me, O holy watchers who give me clarity.

# Line by Line

**Ink written on sheet,  
Food left to eat,  
A man with a dream,  
A dream soon to be,**

**Digital chaos—  
By those without intent,  
A mind guided by fire—  
Bringing forth law,**

**In a trinity may he loose,  
A self whispering polarity,  
Drowned by mania—  
Yet returning into peace.**

This might be my last post for a while. Or maybe not.

I don’t know yet if I want to keep sharing every update, or just go quiet and keep going on my own. Either way, I’m going to keep doing what I do — just maybe without saying much.

All I know is that every time I sit down and go through one more verse, one more line, something in me changes.

Line by line, I feel myself becoming something else.  
Line by line, I’m learning to see more clearly.  
Line by line, I’m not just reading — I’m transforming.  
Line by line, I’m becoming someone I wasn’t before.

I’m 19 years old. And at this pace, I know I’ll come to understand more — really understand — than some people ever will. Not because I’m better. Just because I’m putting in the time, the effort, the care.

I walk away from things that don’t serve me. I don’t go to lectures just to be lectured at. I’d rather solve problems on my own time. Learn fast. Go deep. Not waste a second.

And I can feel people see it in me too — that look of, “You’re not like most.”  
Because I see them, too. I recognize the ones who see far and deep.  
And I think they recognize it in me.

This isn't about building something flashy. It’s about becoming someone true.

So whether I post again tomorrow, next month, or never again — just know I’m still walking.

Line by line.  
Verse by verse.  
Into something holy.
